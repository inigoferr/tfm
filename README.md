## Abstract
Development of a set of active listening strategies that allows a conversational
system for the mental e-health domain to carry out active listening
and obtain information about the users state. For the development of this
set of strategies we will work with different human-human conversations
from a corpus as well as a repository of active listening strategies. Based on
