<clears throat>
<laughter>
<laughter> no i have not <laughter>
<laughter> well um well i mean we met um when i was working at
<laughter> yeah yeah it sucks she's one of the smartest kids in her school
<sigh>
<sigh> being so upset and moving forward
<sigh> uh <sigh>
[laughter]
a little bit close but everybody's pretty much passed away
about four years ago it it became really really bad where i just couldn't sleep through the night i was getting about four hours of sleep
about my mother
about other people or about myself or angry
accomplishments being able to if i or if i'm
albert einstein
all that comparison and then here i am working a little restaurant job so
always
amazing um it was me and my friends we just you know jumped off the boat and you come up over the edge of this
and also singing
and i have no energy
and i skateboard
and i was looking at uh uh other ways to get over the problem and uh then i realized some of my friends were doing meditation and
and it was my boyfriend and we argued because he's trying to be healthy and workout and save money
and raising two children and having two kids i'm very proud of that
and that everything costs a lot of money here
and uh that that made me very happy
and uh yeah it was it was effective you know it was effective in the way you view most everything and in your confidence and that kinda thing
are you happy you did that
are you still doing that
as uh charming
at some point i've had
at the end of the day
aw
awesome
aww
being a positive role model right now um for younger kids that's in um our sports academy program i i think as i got older
berlin wall
born very quickly after he broke the water and oof
both contributed their own proportion
bubbly
but i rely on them a lot so we're close i guess
but it wasn't me
but um
but um you know it's you know you have the the benefit of hindsight and yeah i have a lot of regrets
but you know it was challenging
by you being the first teacher your kids you're you're their one that they see on a daily basis when they wake up so whatever's been taught in the home they lookin' and learning every day you know whether it's a home school you know people kids have a tendency to do things what they see you know what i mean  so you try to keep it positive teach 'em good morals and values and how to get along with other people regardless of race and you know different things of that nature
can you give me an example of that
can you tell me about that
cool
couch potatoes they like to watch reality television so we don't have too much to talk about or things that we can really do um as far as shared activites so you know i love them and everything but there's not too much common ground
could you have done anything to avoid it
couple days ago my football team um we're in the playoffs made the playoffs so that always makes me happy
currently yeah i do yeah
definitely
depression kind of goes with anxiety if it's not under control
did you think you had a problem before you found out
different different people you know different uh
different pace different environment new people
do you consider yourself an introvert
do you feel down
do you have roommates
do you travel a lot
do you wanna talk about anything else
easy to get along with
effectively explain something and and uh it will help you overcome other perceptions of yourself
eh i've been there for ten years and they still argue about the noise of me walking on my hardwood floors
emotional
even <e> even when i'm irritated uh you know i'm very good at controlling uh my temper
excuse me
experience and time
get in a career that is really stable
getting a job i was talking about taking a job somewhere and he was being very supportive and i really wanted him to to say no don't go take that job for six months 'cause i would miss you and he was just being supportive so um
go and see family and friends uh it was pretty nice got a chance to
go for a walk read a book listen to some music
go to the beach
go to vegas
going on a year um
good or bad
goodbye
gosh seven eight different countries i've lived in three or four different countries
happy that i accomplished something you know just even though it may not be much but it was better than just have having a high school diploma and i had um i was working on my bachelor's degree but i ended up in a bad car accident i never went back i got distracted and you know i was working at the same time but i was just like moreso i needed income than than um schooling at that time because i was a young parent you know 'cause i had my daughter at seventeen so i was like i needed the money to support her but i never went back but i feel like it's never too late so
has that gotten you in trouble
have you been diagnosed with depression
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d
have you ever served in the military
have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately
helping
hilarious
hmm
how are you at controlling your temper
how close are you to them
how did serving in the military change you
how did you decide to do that
how did you feel in that moment
how do you cope with them
how do you know them
how do you like your living situation
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep
how hard is that
how has seeing a therapist affected you
how would your best friend describe you
i am a hard worker i think i am um
i applied from a anywhere and everywhere
i did
i didn't think i was gonna get in and i was 'cause it was like a four percent acceptance rate and i was like what are the chances like this is ridiculous i don't think i'm gonna get in
i don't get irritable i think i just uh
i don't have a best friend
i don't know
i don't know honestly
i don't know i don't really have a dream job just something that i can
i don't know i think it's just a matter of finding the right situation so right now eh it's been people are a little conservative about what they want so and how they want it so it's a little tougher than it seems <se> it should be but i don't know i think when the situation's right i don't think it's too difficult
i don't know just
i don't know just uh
i don't know what advice i would give myself
i don't really have a best friend
i don't remember i with those situations i usually try not to remember <laughter> when when it happens i just i just let it go and just like the past is the past i just tend not to look back
i don't travel enough but i have traveled a couple of times uh within the last five years i just came back from new zealand so that was a great experience
i enjoy meeting new people that's the biggest thing about traveling i like seeing new things i like just immersing myself in different cultures and situations and i like
i have a son at u_s_c
i i don't have a problem with that i just get quiet when i feel angry and i try to think before i act
i i i tend to be kind of happy with life 'cause the alternative is gonna harm harm your you know your ability to succeed
i i think they're a little misguided i think a little uninspired [unin] uninspired right now
i just graduated actually um i studied marine biology
i just you know
i know
i like that
i love cooking baking in particularly so i don't know something
i love laughing ugh if somebody's laughing especially my fiancee 'cause she has a great laugh then
i love the holidays i love christmas i love everything about it i love preparing the house for it i love baking cooking
i love the weather the beach
i mean like you know uh <laughter>
i need to think a little more when i'm upset
i only can do so much
i regret
i see them pretty
i see what you mean
i there i either if i'm busy or i'm doing what i you know in whatever job i do i kinda you know get to it i enjoy it uh it's something new for me
i think i would've continued doing that i used to write a lot when i was younger i used to write miniature like little stories  short stories for my parents all the time
i think i've already lived it i'm also a birth doula
i think it's just friends in general who who seem to who seem to do well and i think they they're very inspiring and
i think they would say that i'm very <ver> pretty outgoing i'm pretty
i travel a little bit locally i traveled more when i was younger i really enjoyed that but just been too busy in the last few years
i understand
i used to live in mexico city that was pretty memorable
i usually if it's i usually talk to somebody about it if i can or if i can't then i'll usually do meditation or yoga and try and just let it go
i was just
i was just kind of
i wasn't getting the right therapists recently
i with my third child i had kind of a crazy nurse she was a little
i would probably say that when my gut told me to do something i should've just went on ahead and did it rather than sit and analyze it you know days weeks months later if i feel it in my gut i should go for it so go with my gut more
i would say my family you know my kids you know even though you know i had been having a lot of deaths around me but that's just go that's part of the life experience you know you born here but you gotta leave here one day but
i would tell myself to seek out and listen to people older than me as much as possible
i'd like to give up but
i'd love to hear about one of your trips
i'm actually living it um
i'm getting better i'd say seventy five percent under control
i'm just um a complete panicked anxious wreck i i lose my ability to deal with um
i'm not quite sure um
i'm really proud of who i am i try really hard um i've done a lot of things in my life i'm a really good person i think it's it's kind of rare to find people that are kind and i consider myself
i'm sorry
i'm sorry to hear that
i'm sure i could've yes
i'm trying to think
i've been feeling pretty good actually the holidays were great um
i've done my time uh so to say but uh i took the time you know the last time i just took a lot of time and
if anything i'm i'm uh
if somebody like a person annoys me i'll probably let them know they're annoying me until they stop
in a bad way she was you know suffering a lot and
in the career field
in the new places new faces new experiences i get restless very easily so it's nice to constantly be on the move and
is it uncomfortable for you to talk about this
it
it can totally alter [al] alter anything a parent has tried to put into a child that's good
it helped
it varies like i'm really close to them when it comes to things about like school work um
it was good it was nice
it's more of just like ugh what am i doing da da da that kind of thing
it's not that hard you just gotta get to the skate spots you know i usually like skating um there's some good good spay skate spots in l_a streets in l_a
it's pretty good
it's pretty hard to get discovered and uh
it's totally ancient but um
just her getting into grown folks' business and
just random people who who think it's funny to just sit there and get a rise out of me just it doesn't have to be one any specific
just uh just extreme uh you know avoidance of getting something done that should've been easy for me
kinda sort of kinda just to myself
lack of sympathy
last time i made a film just this last october made a short film
lately i've been better at it just because i think my situation's been a little bit better
let's come back to that later
like
like a lot of work had a good ending
like what
loving nurturing um
make sure that when you marry a man that you ask him if he does drugs or alcohol <laughter>
memorable experiences
memorable experiences um hmm
mhm
mm
mm <sigh>
mm you know cook um
mmm
more lies with the lies that that you already told and i just
most of the time like by the end of the day after i've cooked dinner and we've had dinner together as a family
most proud of
mutual friends mhm
my best friend would say she has not changed since high school <laughter> uh
my best qualities just that uh
my children
my dream job would be probably forestry service
my family we're pretty close my brother lives in colorado my sister lives in oklahoma i have a dad that lives in a neighboring city where i am um
my grandmother she's always been a um a a positive influence uh she's a great black woman um with a old school um
my hip hop
my last child was via c_section so i've had both
my mood swing i mean
my my
my oldest daughter
my parents of course very very much so
my routine of go to school
my sister just passed away
nice
no
no <laughter>
no i have not
no no i'm much <mu> much of more <m> more of an extrovert
not
not at all
not easy usually
now would i give mysef for ten or twenty years ago
of
oh
oh be an attorney [laughter]
oh yes
okay
okay i think i've asked everything i need to
ooh
pardon me
parents
physically mentally spiritually everything
pretty girls
probably
probably my family my my husband and my
probably the
probably um
professor at a place like u_s_c or u_c or l_a or like that
rarely do i have outbursts um
really happy
really happy i mean um
really inspired me he quit drinking he quit smoking he's made a lot of positive changes in his life and i know that those things aren't aren't hard or aren't easy i should say um to <t> so to see someone overcome that
really mad probably not a lot um
right
right now
scrubbed_entry
seem to find most social encounters to be draining where as my my boyfriend for example he um derives a lot of pleasure and energy from being around people for me it's always a little bit the opposite i have to recharge
she has cancer and um she wasn't telling me enough she wasn't giving me enough information and so that made me very angry i was frustrated and angry
she uh she had had the same o_b as i did with all my children
so i trained to do that at at a hospital in inglewood
so that was a really bad time for us
so that's a full time job huh
some of my best qualities um
somebody that owed me money
someone who has been a positive influence in my life
stayed there for a week um i learned about celsius 'cause you know here we have fahrenheit and that was fun uh i learned how to play cricket
stir things up
talented
tell me more about that
thank you so much you've been nice
thanks for sharing your thoughts with me
thanks it was great chatting with you
that is a tough one how 'bout just getting paid to be me
that makes sense
that sounds like a great situation
that sounds really hard
that sucks
that would uh
that's a hard one
that's a long time
that's a tough question
that's good
that's great
that's how i deal with with with with people because i just know there's consequences if i if i didn't deal with it that way
that's it
that's so good to hear
the hardest thing about being a parent
the people who cared about me the people who only interest was to guide me in the right direction
the pretentious people
the roads <laughter> the roads really have a lot of potholes <laughter> <sniffle>
the same path i took
the traffic
the traffic i think that's number one i think everybody hates the traffic and everybody's so busy all the time it's really hard to to get together with anybody everybody's so devoted to their jobs and uh then we're sitting in traffic a lot too
the troubling times
the twenty seventh of december that was fantastic <fantas> we only stayed for two days we had a really good time uh we saw a great show
there are always trade offs in life aren't there
there are days when it takes almost one two hours to uh go to sleep
there's great food here the weather is great most of the time there's a lot of sunshine it doesn't get cold i don't have to shovel snow
they really some of 'em would numb me some of them would
they would probably tell you that i'm also very serious and uh
think a lot longer and harder before you make 'em and i think the outcome would been a little different today
three hundred and fifty people in there it was pretty fun but it was also not that fun because there was so many people and you couldn't really move so
through all the traveling and and meeting new people and um eating you know different um diverse foods and uh it was a good experience for me
to be honest i don't know
try to free myself from the situation to clear my mind usually take a walk or something like that or just just just go in a room by myself and just try to clear my head <he> my head
uh
uh <laughter>
uh and you know also like
uh for an all white oh uh an all white tiger act and uh working for a japanese circus
uh fun i
uh huh
uh i do think it's useful if you have the right therapist i think if you don't have a good relationship with your therapist it can be incredibly harmful i have talked to people that have had bad experiences and and won't ever go back
uh i had an uncle who lived in uh wisconsin who was a dairy farmer so my dad used to love to drive and i love to drive also
uh i love exercising i actually like working out now uh i used to think it was a chore but now i'm really really getting into it
uh i think it's difficult i think it's a difficult job that takes a lot more work than most people give it credit for if you wanna do it right you know it's always second guessing your behavior and that kind of thing
uh i think that's that was aggravating for me too because i'm a patient person realistic and um and i tried everything to avoid uh confrontation in the matter but it was just required to try to you know help me cover the damage to our lives my daughter's life
uh i'm friendly
uh in terms of lashing out at other people physically i don't do that but in order to let off some aggressions if if need be i'll i'm not above you know
uh it's hard with dealing with people especially trying not to react 'cause there's consequences for your reactions
uh more capable and more confident about things
uh music uh seeing movies any kind of uh adventure somewhere
uh no
uh not as often as i would like i used to go back like at least once a year but in the last few years that's diminished so i would say like every three years
uh not very often so once every five years or so
uh oh
uh other joyful occasions have been you know like christmas and you know family gatherings and
uh peaceful do i feel peaceful well yeah i was peaceful that it that it's settled uh but but angry that it ever happened
uh right now it's super lame but i watch t_v
uh success and commericalization and that kind of thing
uh that is a little bit harder i think when you first make the adjustment
uh well
uh when i was younger i was in the boy scouts and we used to go camping all the time and one year we went to
um
um caring and uh enthusatic for life
um he would probably say passionate intelligent um he always tells me that i'm really hard on myself which is true um dedicated loyal
um i guess it depends on who you talk to
um i had a different option to live with somebody else
um i just i just try to be nice to everybody and
um i knew something wasn't right
um i mean it depends on what you mean by therapy like i or most people probably can't afford good therapy but just even talking to friends i would consider therapy somebody who will listen so helps you get stuff off your chest
um i think maybe
um i worry sometimes about you know work issues but it's pretty pretty easy
um i'm okay with it at times um uh but i can defintely be better
um i'm sure they weren't happy
um just that i was noticing that i was noticing i was feeling very uh in my paralegal class i had a a section about employment law
um just the independence about it being alone being able to be free and not tied down to one to one thing you know it's great
um let's see
um like i say bike riding or uh walks on the beach the beach is very relaxing
um meditate excercise go out in nature just um unplug get myself away from the computer away from technology away from people
um no
um no i think it was what they call free [flee] float free floating anxiety more of a of of uh organic
um not really
um okay i'm panicky about the job situation
um so so that's a positive thing but well the when i was drinking it helped me just forget and numb myself
um the love of my children
um there's always something to do
um when i have a job when i when i'm able to work
we left on our anniversary day flew to israel
well i still like sports you know and
well i was working at l_a_x
well i'm not going to therapy now but
well just raising a daughter extendedly you know or or uh
what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago
what are some things that make you really mad
what are some things that usually put you in a good mood
what are some things you don't really like about l_a
what are some things you like to do for fun
what are some things you really like about l_a
what are you like when you don't sleep well
what are you most proud of in your life
what do you do now
what do you do when you're annoyed
what do you enjoy about traveling
what do you think of today's kids
what made you decide to do that
what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy
what were your symptoms
what would you say are some of your best qualities
what'd you study at school
what's it like for you living with them
what's one of your most memorable experiences
what's the best thing about being a parent
what's the hardest thing about being a parent
what's your dream job
whatever comes to your mind
when do i give up and sell my soul and go back to the corporate world of sitting in little cubicles i don't know
when i went on a cruise which was a happy experience when i went on a cruise to mexico with my family um  when i was sixteen about six years ago
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
when was the last time you felt really happy
which is near the uh
who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life
why
why why
with my brother and their family
wow
wow uh
yeah
yeah i guess for a while when when you think about it uh when you watch them go through their struggles it's hard to watch
yeah i mean yeah i guess it was <laughter>
yeah i plan to go to the bahamas next year
yeah i understand
yeah so i'm working at l_a_x right now
yeah stressed more stressed
yeah that sucks
yeah uh a little bit
yes
yes that's that's that's why it's a regret because it could've been avoided there's things we could've done and we were spending our time working and more concerned about getting ahead than actually family and what's closest to us
you know
you know didn't like that at all
you were very young weren't you
you'd probably say oh she seems like a nice young lady or whatever you know something like that
